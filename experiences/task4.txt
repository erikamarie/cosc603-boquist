Task 4
This task was the most complicated of each of the tasks. I quickly became familiar with updating my local copies of my source and documentation as well as committing and pushing my changes to the repository. That being said, I have very little familiarity with C, so even with a substantial amount of "googling" how to quickly understand a C program, I had difficulty understanding exactly how the Stutter program worked, not what it was accomplishing.
My Java programming abilities have clearly relapsed in the execution of this task as my daily duties are almost entire JavaScript. I have completed the coding portion of this task to the best of my abilities and to my understanding of the assignment itself.
